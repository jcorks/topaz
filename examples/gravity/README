The contents of this directory is dedicated to base topaz examples 
written using the scripting backend built into topaz.

Specifically, the examples have been rewritten in gravity.


Gravity is a small, Swift-like language with a small 
footprint, decent performance, object-oriented syntax, 
and a lot of flexibility.

More info on the language and its operation can be found 
here: https://marcobambini.github.io/gravity/


Pros:
 - Good object-oriented functionality
 - Familiar C* feel
 - Closures / functions as first class objects 
 - Class integration with topaz 

Cons:
 - Limited debugger support (no source-based breakpoints, breaking needs to be done in-source, no scoped eval)
 - Some limitations for source tracing when an error occurs 
 - Limited language documentation




The C example for using scripts (examples/c/10-Scripts/)  
can be used for all the example directories. The binary will need 
to be copied to any directory to run the example.

the "script" file is the default file that the driver will look for 
and run.


Each "script" file contains extensive comments and info regarding 
how to use both topaz and how to navigate the scripting interface. The 
info for each example builds off the previous, so reading in order, 
starting with 1-Entity, can serve as a manual.
