The contents of this directory is dedicated to base topaz examples 
written using the scripting backend built into topaz.

Specifically, the examples have been rewritten in DuktapeJS, a flavor 
of ECMAscript.


DuktapeJS is a reliable, low-footprint, capable language bringing withit 
unparalleled flexibility.

More info on the project and its operation can be found 
here: https://duktape.org/


Pros:
 - Can quickly write small applications
 - Familiar JS feel, plenty of resources
 - A lot of core JS features, like advanced object manipulation and regex
 - Full debugger support (breakpoints, stepping, scoped evaluation)
Cons:
 - Lack of strict class-based syntax; its easy to write confusing code.
 - Error locations can sometimes be inaccurately reported.




The C example for using scripts (examples/c/10-Scripts/)  
can be used for all the example directories. The binary will need 
to be copied to any directory to run the example.

the "script" file is the default file that the driver will look for 
and run.


Each "script" file contains extensive comments and info regarding 
how to use both topaz and how to navigate the scripting interface. The 
info for each example builds off the previous, so reading in order, 
starting with 1-Entity, can serve as a manual.
