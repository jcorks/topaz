// In the previous example, we defined our own entity and 
// used a built-in component, Shape2D, to provide our entity 
// the ability to show 2D shapes on the screen
//
// In this example, we will explore the concept of components more
// by making our own.
//
// 
// 

// Here, we're going to make a component and an entity 
// that could serve as part of a game. In this game,
// people (a 'Person' entity) can give each other fruit, 
// so a component was made to facilitate holding the fruit
// ('FruitBasket'). 
//
// Why use a component instead of just a simple variable
// for this purpose?
//
// A few reasons:
// - On a basic level, a simple variable may work, but for 
//   further development and consistent behavior,
//   it makes sense to have a separate class wrap the 
//   conceptual behavior regarding health. Consider things 
//   like max capacity, what happens when fruit equals 0, and 
//   other things. While you could still manage these within 
//   the entity, having it be a standard separate class 
//   increases readability and maintainability, especially with 
//   functions to interact with it.
//
// - Someone familiar with object oriented programming may ask:
//   why not just use a normal class? That would most certainly be 
//   a valid approach! However, components have 2 significant 
//   uses 1) Components are essentially event systems;
//   they can be extended to support custom events which other objects 
//   can subscribe to. 2) like Entities, they can be updated every 
//   frame with onStep() and onDraw() functions. 
//   It's up to you when to choose to write a new entity, component,
//   or a simple plain object.

    // Since we want certain, specific behavior to happen when

    // "amount" a private variable. Here, only this FruitBasket instance 
    // can touch "amount".
    var amount = 5;

// the specified event is detected.

// that the closure we pass has a second argument.

// this will print various statements to the console.
// Notice how both our custom notification and the base notification are 
// called; also note the order. Hooks / handlers installed last are called first.

// Notice how there was no need to populate Topaz.root.

// managed by topaz. There may be times where you dont 
// need to attach entities for the lifetime of the 
// program.
