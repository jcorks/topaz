// In JS, topaz implements its entities as "tclass" objects, which are class objects
// with special properties. To demonstrate this, we will make our own entity
// specification and instantiage it.
//
// As a review, entities are the basic building blocks within 
// a topaz program. They are updated every frame once the engine is started 
// and can contain their own properties and components.
//
// Typically, entities will be extended in 2 ways:
//  - Populating an update function such as onStep or onDraw, which will 
//    be called every frame.
//  - Attaching components to the entity to extend its behavior in reusable ways.
//
//
// The entity we want to create will:
//  - Show a colored rectangle on the screen
//  - Change the rotation of the rectangle 
//    every frame.
//
// Every custom entity will be its own tclass that inherits from either Topaz.Entity
// directly, or another Topaz.Entity-based class.
//
var Rectangle = tclass({
    inherits : Topaz.Entity,
    // The define property is a special function to the class uses 
    // to construct new instances. entclass is a reference to the output 
    // of tclass which can be used as a place for static class storage.
    // ent is the new instance being created.
    define : function(entclass, ent) {
        // The define function is called to initialize parameters of the 
        // entity that are private to its definition.
        //
        // Our entity will have a visual associated with it, so 
        // Shape2D is the basic component for drawing 2D shapes.
        // It can be formed into any shape, but we will stick with 
        // a basic rectangle.
        const visual = Topaz.Shape2D.new();

        // This changes the shape into a 200 by 200 rectangle.
        visual.formRectangle(200, 200);

        // By default, the center of a Shape2D is the top-left 
        // of the shape. Since rotation is about the center,
        // the set the center to one half of the rectangles span.
        visual.center = Vector.new({x=100, y=100});


        // Even though the component has all the information 
        // we want stored within it, the component cannot update itself.
        // We still have to associate it with our entity.
        // This can be done by using the addComponent() function.
        //
        ent.addComponent(visual);


    
        // Along with components, every entity can have a custom set of 
        // update functions. The most common one is onStep() which is 
        // run every frame. Note how the props instance is the first 
        // argument like with onReady().
        ent.onStep = function() {

            // Every entity has built-in properties, such as 
            // position, rotation, and scale.
            // Here, we add 0.001, 0.002, and 0.003 degrees to the x, y, and z 
            // rotation respectively every frame. 
            //
            // The position, rotation, and scale properties are vector objects,
            // so to update them, you actually replace them with new vectors.
            const r = ent.rotation;
            ent.rotation = Topaz.Vector({
                x=r.x + 0.01,
                y=r.y + 0.2,
                z=r.z + 0.03
            });
        }


        // Every prefab object for entities is expected 
        // to contain a "props" property. The props object 
        // is the main way that you as a user will refer to public members.
        // when instantiated, props' properties will be copied to 
        // the entity instance.
        ent.interface({
            // Here we'll set up a public function to modify the color 
            // of the object.
            setColor : function(color) {
                // It will take a color object and set the color property 
                // of the Shape2D
                visual.color = color;
            }  
        });
    }
});


// Now that the entity has been defined, we need to actually use it.
//

// This instantiates the entity we've defined based on its prefab as a "blueprint".
var entity = Rectangle.new()

// The color of any Shape2D can be assigned directly. 
// The string can be a common color name, or a #RRGGBB/AA 
// formatted hex string.
entity.setColor(Topaz.Color.new('purple'));        



// The default position for an entity is 0,0,0,
// so we'll want to move it. Note how we set the center 
// of the Shape2D component already: topaz is inherently 
// hierarchical: objects will use the position / rotation / scale 
// of things that they are attached to. 
entity.position = Vector.new({x=200, y=200});


// Even though we've created the our rectangle entity,
// creating the entity on its own doesnt do much.
// Much like when we created the component, 
// topaz still needs to be aware of what to do with it.
//
// Topaz manages entities in the form of a tree, so     
// entities naturally can have children entities 
// and a parent entity. The root is the very base of the tree.
// Since we are only making one entity, we will just 
// set the entity has the root itself.
//
// Normally, the root will be more symbolic than physical,
// think of a "room" in a game.
//
// The tree can be manipulated while running to control 
// runtime efficiency for the program.
//
Topaz.root = entity;
