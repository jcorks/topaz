The contents of this directory is dedicated to base topaz examples 
written using the scripting backend built into topaz.
Using scripting is the main, intended way of writing games and interactive 
programs with topaz.

Specifically, the examples have been rewritten in Matte, a language 
created for scripting.


Matte is a new, flexible, and expressive language bringing with
it a well-rounded set of tools for decent maintainability.

More info on the project and its operation can be found 
here: https://jcorks.github.io/Matte/


Pros:
 - Can quickly write small applications
 - Familiar JS feel
 - Object Oriented features like classes, operator overloading, etc.
 - Full debugger support (breakpoints, stepping, scoped evaluation)
Cons:
 - It's "homemade" (by me) and lacks in speed
 - Continually under development




To run each example, a binary must be present. The binary will need 
to be copied to any directory to run the example. You can either build 
it yourself or 

the "main.mt" file is the default file that the driver will look for 
and run.


Each "main.mt" file contains extensive comments and info regarding 
how to use both topaz and how to navigate the scripting interface. The 
info for each example builds off the previous, so reading in order, 
starting with 1-Entity, can serve as a manual.
