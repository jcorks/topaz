# topaz

*(STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT. No APIs are guaranteed yet as stable.)*

A code-focused game development toolkit: no IDE, no asset manager, just pure code.
Written in plain C in an Object-Oriented style, topaz features a small but powerful 
API that focuses on 2D and simple 3D graphics.

 - Minimal requirements. On Windows, no additional DLLs are required to run EXEs.
 - High-level, Node / hierarchy based design, giving tree-like control to scenes all in code.
 - Built-in scripting support which provides bindings for the core C API, including Lua
 - Multi-window support.
 - Graphics, input, audio, resource manager, and more with system-agnostic API.
 - Customizable console with scripting debug support in GDB style commands.
 - Raw mesh and texture access for all visuals.


See [SCRIPTING.md](https://github.com/jcorks/topaz/blob/main/SCRIPTING.md) for more information on the scripting API and making a decision on which language to use.
