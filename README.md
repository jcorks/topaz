# Topaz

*(STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT. No APIs are guaranteed yet as stable.)*

Standalone, embeddable program that acts as a game scripting toolkit.
The most common way to use topaz is to run it in a directory with 
a root file (main.mt) that contains the logic to to your game.

Examples can be found under ./examples/. ./examples/README explains 
more.



Scripting is done with the Matte language, an 
imperative C-like that features simplified, readable code.
