/// Topaz is a slim, pure-C API for writing games and 
/// other interactive media.
///
/// Most other toolkits with a similar use 
/// will require specific dependencies ahead of time 
/// that users must adhere to. Topaz lets you 
/// choose from a collection of backends to map specific 
/// behaviors, implement a platform-dependent one
/// or remove those behaviors altogether. Dynamic platform 
/// switching combined with a pure C interface makes 
/// topaz a reasonable tool for platforms with 
/// limited availability to more rich backends.
