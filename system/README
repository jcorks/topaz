Within this directory, you may find some default 
implementations of backends for common systems.

Each directory represents a compliant library/environment
that is required to build with this backend. 

Each directory is in the following format:

[backend_name]/[environment_name]/
    |-meson.build 
    |-compat_test.c [optional]
    |-src/
        |-[files].c/h
        |-backend.h


Meson is the build system of choice for Topaz. The meson.build 
file is meant to handle the logic of adding auxiliary files, libraries,
include directories, and possible system tests to allow the build 
system to integrate the implementation into the library/binary.

TODO: full documentation on how to interact with the build 
      and organize data per directory (Meson interaction 
      is still in flux)




      
backend.h will always exist within src and contains a single
function. This is the public-facing api and it creates a 
single instance of the backend in question. It is of the 
format:



#ifndef H_TOPAZDC__[backend_name][environment_name]__INCLUDED
#define H_TOPAZDC__[backend_name][environment_name]__INCLUDED

topazBackend_t * topaz_system_[backend_name]_[environment_name]__backend();

void             topaz_system_[backend_name]_[environment_name]__api(topaz[backend_name]API_t *);

#endif
