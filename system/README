Within this directory, you may find some default 
implementations of backends for common systems.

Each directory represents a compliant library/environment
that is required to build with this backend. 

Each directory is in the following format:

[backend_name]_[environment_name]/
    |-C_INCLUDES   
    |-C_LIBRARIES
    |-C_SOURCES
    |-src/
        |-[files].c/h
        |-backend.h


C_LIBRARIES is a text file that contains the linker
libraries required to compile. C_INCLUDES is a text 
file that contains the includes required for this
to compile with the topaz project. [files] is a 
placeholder for all the sources/headers that 
make up this backend implementation. C_SOURCES
shoudl be an enumeration of just the source file names.


backend.h will always exist within src and contains a single
function. This is the public-facing api and it creates a 
single instance of the backend in question. It is of the 
format:



#ifndef H_TOPAZDC__[backend_name][environment_name]__INCLUDED
#define H_TOPAZDC__[backend_name][environment_name]__INCLUDED

topazBackend_t * topaz_system_[backend_name]_[environment_name]__backend();

void             topaz_system_[backend_name]_[environment_name]__api(topaz[backend_name]API_t *);

#endif
